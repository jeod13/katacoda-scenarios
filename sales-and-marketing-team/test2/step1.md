# Try to set a password 
Try to set a password in the password field, it will show the strength of your password. <br /><br />

If the strength your password is 'strong', congratulations you can directly use it as password.<br /><br />

If the strength your password is below 'strong', lets have a look on how to create a strong password as shown below.<br /><br />

# Importance of Password
Your passwords grant access into your own account with different privileges, so you are probably thinking 'what are the best practices to create a strong password' to protect your accounts against these cybercriminals. If your passwords were part of a data breach, you will want to change them immediately.

# The most common way to set a strong password
1.  Make it long.<br />
This is the most critical factor. Choose nothing shorter than 15 characters, more if possible.<br />
2.  Use a mix of characters. The more you mix up letters (upper-case and lower-case), numbers, and symbols, the more potent your password is, and the harder it is for a brute force attack to crack it.<br />
3. Don’t use memorable keyboard paths or very simple password. Much like the advice above not to use sequential letters and numbers, do not use sequential keyboard paths either (like qwerty) and simple password like 'password'. These are among the first to be guessed.<br /><br />

You may consider the high complexity of the password will forget easily. And Now, the scenario introduce 2 method to create a strong and memorable password.<br /><br />

# The revised passphrase method

This is the multiple word phrase method with a twist — choose bizarre and uncommon words. Use proper nouns, the names of local businesses, historical figures, any words you know in another language, etc. A hacker might guess Quagmire, but he or she would find it ridiculously challenging to try to guess a good password example<br /> like this:<br /><br />

QuagmireCOMP3335mutsukashii<br /><br />

While the words should be uncommon, try to compose a phrase that gives you a mental image. This will help you remember.<br /><br />

To crank it up another notch in complexity, you can add random characters in the middle of your words or between the words. Just avoid underscores between words and any common leetspeak* substitutions. (*leetspeak: an informal language or code used on the Internet, in which standard letters are often replaced by numerals or special characters.)<br />
like this:<br /><br />

Quag#mireTCOMP33&35mutsuskashii<br /><br />

# The sentence method
This method is also described as the "Bruce Schneier Method." The idea is to think of a random sentence and transform it into a password using a rule. For example, taking the first two letters of every word in “The Old Duke is my favorite pub in South London” would give you:<br /><br />

ThOlDuismyfapuinSoLo<br /><br />

To anyone else, it’s gobbledygook, but to you it makes perfect sense. Make sure the sentence you choose is as personal and unguessable as possible.
# Remember password is just a small pieces in Security, you should be consider security awareness in anytime.
For example, Logout Wordpress after you have done your job to prevent others can use your accounts to do anything.
